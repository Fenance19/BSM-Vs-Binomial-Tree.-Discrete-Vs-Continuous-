# BSM-Vs-Binomial-Tree.-Discrete-Vs-Continuous-
Simple illustration of assumption similarities and the evolution that takes place between the Binomial Tree pricer and the BSM.

The binomial model came after the contiunous state model of the BSM, yet as we add many steps we see the convergence into the black scholes framework. 

Following the idea of being delta hedged, we can perfectly price these option contracts via the risk neutral frame work!
This usually helps people understand how simple the BSM is when we discretize time and look at each node of an option. Also helps understand the risk-neutral measure as it follows a martingale and assumes the beauty of the replication argument both the BSM and the CRR Binomial Model Produced in the world of Financial Math.
