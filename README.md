# BSM-Vs-Binomial-Tree.-Discrete-Vs-Continuous-
Simple illustration of assumption similarities and the evolution that takes place between the Binomial Tree pricer and the BSM.

The binomial model came after the contiunous state model of the BSM, yet as we add many steps we see the convergence into the black scholes framework. 

Following the idea of being delta hedged, we can perfectly price these option contracts via the risk neutral frame work!
This usually helps people understand how simple the BSM is when we discretize time and look at each node of an option. Also helps understand the risk-neutral measure as it follows a martingale and protrays the beauty of the replication argument both in the BSM and the CRR Binomial Model Produced in the world of Financial Math.

#### A little more on risk-neutral measure as I did not touch on it much in the actual code; The "beauty" you mentioned lies in the fact that we don't need to know the actual drift ($\mu$) of the stock.The Martingale PropertyIn the risk-neutral world, we assume every investor is indifferent to risk. Therefore, every tradable asset must earn the risk-free rate ($r$). Under this measure, the discounted stock price process is a Martingale: $$E^\mathbb{Q}[e^{-rT} S_T | \mathcal{F}_t] = e^{-rt} S_t$$Why Subjective Beliefs Don't MatterWhether you are a "bull" who thinks the stock will moon or a "bear" who thinks it will crash, the price of the option remains the same.In the Binomial Tree: The risk-neutral probability $p = \frac{e^{r\Delta t} - d}{u - d}$ is derived solely from $r, u,$ and $d$.In BSM: The $\mu$ term is replaced by $r$ in the partial differential equation.Because we can Delta Hedge (perfectly replicate the option using the stock), we have eliminated the specific risk of the stock. If the risk is gone, the "risk premium" (the extra return investors demand for holding a risky asset) must also vanish. Thus, the market's subjective "greed" or "fear" is irrelevant to the no-arbitrage price.

The journey from the Binomial Tree to Black-Scholes-Merton demonstrates how discrete, intuitive steps converge into a continuous mathematical framework. By applying the Replication Argument and Delta Hedging, both models utilize the Risk-Neutral Measure ($\mathbb{Q}$). In this framework, the discounted price process is a Martingale, meaning the expected return is simply the risk-free rate. This renders subjective investor beliefs irrelevant; as long as no-arbitrage holds, the option price is determined solely by volatility and the risk-free rate, not by the market's direction-based optimism.Quick References[Hull, J.
